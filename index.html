            <p> COW seeks to facilitate the collection, dissemination, and use of accurate and reliable quantitative data in international relations. Key principles of the project include a commitment to standard scientific principles of replication, data reliability, documentation, review, and the transparency of data collection procedures. More specifically, we are committed to the free public release of data sets to the research community, to release data in a timely manner after data collection is completed, to provide version numbers for data set and replication tracking, to provide appropriate dataset documentation, and to attempt to update, document, and distribute follow-on versions of datasets where possible. We intend to use our website as the center of our data distribution efforts, to serve as central site for collection of possible error information and questions, to provide a forum for interaction with users of Correlates of War data, and as a way for the international relations community to contribute to the continuing development of the project.

            <h2>History <br>of COW preject</h2>
            <p class="article-open">The Correlates of War Project was founded in 1963 by J. David Singer, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. The original and continuing goal of the project has been the systematic accumulation of scientific knowledge about war. Joined by historian Melvin Small, the project began its work by assembling a more accurate data set on the incidence and extent of inter-state and extra-systemic war in the post-Napoleonic period. To do this scientifically Singer and Small found they needed to operationally resolve a number of difficult issues such as what is a “state” and what precisely is a “war.” Building upon the work of other pioneers such as Pitirim Sorokin, Lewis Frye Richardson, and Quincy Wright, Singer and Small published The Wages of War in 1972, a work that established a standard definition of war that has guided the research of hundreds of scholars since its publication.</p>

            <p class="hidden">This publication was only the beginning of the project, for the fundamental goal of the project was not just to measure the temporal and spatial variation in war but rather to identify factors that would systematically explain this variation. Accordingly, early efforts were undertaken to measure many of those factors that purportedly accounted for war such as national capability, alliances, geography, polarity, and status in the post-Napoleonic period, and the list of data sets assembled by the project has continued to grow over the years. In addition to the collection of data, the project has conducted many empirical studies about war and conflict. An important progeny of the project is the Behavioral Correlates of War project headed by Russell Leng. Through the years, the project has served as a major training ground for young scholars, and many of today’s best known and widely respected international relations scholars are “products” of the project. More generally, the correlates of war project promoted cumulative science in the field of international relations when the scientific study of politics was in its infancy. By helping to establish a clear temporal and spatial domain for research, promoting the use of clearly defined concepts and common variable operationalizations, and allowing replication of research, the project has been a mainstay of rigorous international relations scholarship.</p>
            <p class="hidden">In the late 1990s scholars became concerned about how the work of the project could be continued given the pending retirement of J. David Singer, and arrangements were made to transfer the project to Penn State under the leadership of Stuart A. Bremer. This transfer was marked by a March, 2001, conference discussing the future study of war, held at Penn State. Penn State has archived all available original material from the Correlates of War project, and is extending and enlarging the data collection efforts it began.</p>
            <p class="hidden">In 2002-2005, the project was led by Interim Director D. Scott Bennett and Associate Director Glenn Palmer. In 2005-2012, Paul Diehl served as project's Director, and as of January 2013, the project continues under Director Zeev Maoz and Associate Director D. Scott Bennett (who has served in this capacity since 2005).</p>

            <h2>State System Membership</h2>
            <p class="article-open">This data set contains the list of states in the international system as updated and distributed by the Correlates of War Project. These data sets identify states, their standard Correlates of War "country code" or state number (used throughout the Correlates of War project data sets), state abbreviations, and dates of membership as states and major powers in the international system. Version 2016 extends the temporal domain of the collection through December 2016.</p>

            <p class="hidden">Data Set<br>The files associated with the interstate system membership data set can be obtained either individually in .csv (comma-delimited) format. In this format, values are separated by commas, with string values (e.g. state names) in quotations. The first line of each data file is a header record containing the variable names.</p>

            <h2>Dyadic Inter-state War Dataset</h2>
            <p class="article-open">The dyadic war dataset is built and fully compatible with the dyadic MID dataset (Maoz et al. 2019). It provides dyadic records of interstate wars over the period of 1816-2010, with a dyad-year unit of analysis. The dataset contains several innovations and changes compared to the war or MID datasets. Specifically,
                <br>&bull; It applies the definition of war and war participation to a dyadic setting. A dyadic war is defined as a series of sustained and lethal battles between the armed forces of two states that is a part or the whole of an interstate war.
            </p>
            
            <p class="hidden">&bull; For a dyadic war to be present both states must meet one or both of the following conditions: (1) the state must suffer 100 or more battle-related deaths in the battles with the other state, or (2) the state must deploy 1,000 or more troops in battles against the other state.
            <br>&bull; War outbreak and war termination is defined in terms of battles, not in terms of declarations of war. A dyadic war starts on the start date of the first battle between the armed forces of the states making up the dyad. Accordingly, a dyadic ends on the last day of the last battle between the armed forces of the dyad.
            <br>&bull; Each war is identified both in terms of its own dyadic code, and in terms of the dyadic MID of which it is a part.
            <br>&bull; The data have been cleaned and each dyad that was part of a multilateral war was researched separately to determine whether it met the conditions stated above. The data also reflect a systematic comparison to the COW war data and another interstate war dataset (Reiter, Stam, and Horowitz 2014).
            <br>&bull; To the extent possible, fatality data were broken down by individual state and dyad. However, in many cases involving a state that fights several opponents in the context of a multilateral war, such a breakdown is not possible. We provide “best” estimates of this breakdown.
            <br>&bull; The data are fully compatible with the dyadic MID dataset. The dyadic war dataset is a proper subset of the dyadic MID dataset: every war in the dyadic MID dataset is part of a dyadic MID (but not vice versa).
            <br>&bull; The outcome of the war is adjusted for the specific dyad. The winner in a dyadic war may have a different designation than the winning side in the COW war dataset.
            <br>&bull; We assign specific roles to joiners in multilateral war: a joiner on the target side in a multilateral war may be the initiator against a state on the initiator’s side in the multilateral war.
